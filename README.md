# GUI Driven Text Compression

This project is a GUI-driven application for text compression, developed using both Java and Python. The primary focus of the project is to demonstrate the concepts of Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) and Object-Oriented Programming (OOP).

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:

- **Java Source Files:**
  - `compression.java` - Handles the text compression logic.
  - `CompressionRatio.java` - Calculates the compression ratio.
  - `FileChooserExample.java` - Provides a GUI for file selection.
  - `Huffman.java` - Implements Huffman coding for compression.
  - `Leaf.java` - Represents a leaf node in the Huffman tree.
  - `LZ77.java` - Implements the LZ77 compression algorithm.
  - `LZW.java` - Implements the LZW compression algorithm.
  - `Main.java` - The main entry point of the application.
  - `Node.java` - Represents a node in the Huffman tree.
  - `python.java` - Integrates Python scripts with Java.
  - `Triple.java` - Utility class for the LZW algorithm.

- **Python Source Files:**
  - `Huffman_tree_visualisation.py` - Visualizes the Huffman tree.

- **Configuration Files:**
  - `Requirments.txt` - Lists the dependencies for the Python scripts.

## Features

- **Huffman Coding:** Efficient text compression using variable-length codes.
- **LZ77 Algorithm:** Sliding window compression technique.
- **LZW Algorithm:** Dictionary-based compression method.
- **GUI Interface:** User-friendly interface for file selection and compression operations.
- **Visualization:** Graphical representation of Huffman trees for better understanding.

## Requirements

To run the Python scripts, ensure you have the required dependencies listed in `Requirments.txt`. You can install them using:

```bash
pip install -r Requirments.txt
```

## How to Run

Follow these steps to run the application:

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   
   ```bash
   git clone [your-repo-link]
   ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**

   ```bash
   cd [project-directory]
   ```

3. **Compile the Java Files:**
   
   ```bash
   javac *.java

   ```

4. **Run the Main Java Application:**
   
   ```bash
   java Main
   ```
